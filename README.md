# Jupyter Notebook Trials

This is a repo of jupyter notebooks in which I try stuff out and create little tools for myself.

This contains a mixture of different projects:

## Activity Network

This will solve an activity network, calculating drag and the critical path

## EVA Calculator

Will calculate all EVA equations for given data

## Kernel Trick

This is an implementation of the Kernel Trick algorithm for ML

## ID3

This is an algorithm which generates a search tree

## KNN

This is an implementation of the K nearest network algorithm using a number of ML libraries

## ROC Calculator

Calculates ROC based on figures

## Met Police Data

Analytics based on Open Source Met police data
